## License

This code is licensed to GNU-GPL. It means you can take the code and modify it as you wish, but you must also make such a modified code subsequently open source. This is a win-win situation. If you improve our code, we enjoy updates. If we improve it, you do too.

## Bounty

If you are a talented developer, you can contribute to the code. You can implement new features or fix bugs. Just fork and submit your code improvements. We will happily reward you with some satoshis (Bitcoin).

## Collaboration

If you are a VPN provider, you can feel free to use this code and customise it with your own branding. We have no problem with that. You can even hire our developer to such end. The only thing we ask in return is that you share your code so we can mutually benefit from each others’ improvements. If you have some money, you can also directly contribute to a cash pool that will support this software development. Contact us through https://proxy.sh/contact for more details.
